# Password Strength Task 6

## Overview
This project evaluates the strength of various passwords by testing them on online password strength checkers. The goal is to understand password complexity, identify best practices for creating secure passwords, and summarize common password attacks.

## Passwords Tested & Results

| Password               | Strength   | Feedback Summary                                  |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| simplepass             | Very Weak  | Too short, lacks numbers and symbols              |
| SimplePass1            | Weak       | Needs more special characters and longer length  |
| S1mple@Pass            | Medium     | Good mix of characters, length could be longer   |
| S!mpl3P@ssw0rd#2025    | Strong     | Excellent length, complexity, unpredictable       |
| Cyb3r_Secure!$2025     | Strong     | Unique, varied character types, good length       |

*Passwords were evaluated using [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/). Screenshots of these tests are included in the `screenshots/` directory.*

## Password Security Insights

- Strong passwords are usually at least 12 characters long and contain uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
- Avoid personal info, dictionary words, and simple patterns.
- Password complexity significantly reduces vulnerability to brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Use unique passwords for different accounts and consider password managers for convenience and security.

## Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack:** Trying all possible character combinations until the password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using lists of common passwords or words to guess the password.
- **Social Engineering/Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their passwords.

## Best Practices

- Use long and complex passwords combining different character types.
- Avoid using repeated characters or easily guessable sequences.
- Employ multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Consider passphrases for easier memorability with strong security.
